    ======================================================================

     Rappture is the Rapid APPlication infrastrucTURE, a toolkit for
     building scientific applications with a minimum of fuss and bother.

     It was developed by the Network for Computational Nanotechnology
     (NCN), an NSF-funded project creating cyberinfrastructure in support
     of a science gateway for nanotechnology simulation.

     See the following web site for an overview and documentation:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Rappture is a freely available, open source package.  You can
     do virtually anything you like with it, such as modifying it,
     redistributing it, and selling it either in whole or in part.
     But you can't prevent anyone else from doing the same, and you
     must keep all copyright notices intact, so the ownership and
     authorship is clear.

     See the file "license.terms" for complete information.

     Developed by Michael McLennan, George Howlett, and Derrick Kearney.
     Special thanks to Ben Rafferty for Java bindings and the Rappture
     tester, and Ben Haley for Ruby bindings.
