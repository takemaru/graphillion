class EdgeVertexSetSet(object):
    """Represents and manipulates a set of sets containing edges and vertices.

    A EdgeVertexSetSet object stores a set of sets containing edges and vertices.
    A graph stored must be a subgraph of the universal graph, and is represented
    by a list of edges and vertices in the universal graph. If an edge is
    contained in a list, both the endpoints of the edge are also contained in the
    list. An edge is a tuple of two vertices, and a vertex can be any hashable
    object like a number, a text string, and a tuple.  Currently,
    EdgeVertexSetSet only supports undirected graphs without edge labels.

    The universal graph must be defined before creating EdgeVertexSetSet
    objects by `EdgeVertexSetSet.set_universe()` method.

    Like Python set types, EdgeVertexSetSet supports `graph in graphset`,
    `len(graphset)`, and `for graph in graphset`.  It also supports
    all set methods and operators,
    * isdisjoint(), issubset(), issuperset(), union(), intersection(),
      difference(), symmetric_difference(), copy(), update(),
      intersection_update(), difference_update(),
      symmetric_difference_update(), add(), remove(), discard(),
      pop(), clear(),
    * ==, !=, <=, <, >=, >, |, &, -, ^, |=, &=, -=, ^=.

    Examples:
      >>> from graphillion import GraphSet, EdgeVertexSetSet

      We assume the following graph and register the edge list as the
      universe.

      1 --- 2 --- 3
      |     |     |
      4 --- 5 --- 6

      >>> universe = [(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)]
      >>> GraphSet.set_universe(universe)
      >>> EdgeVertexSetSet.set_universe()

      Find all paths from 1 to 6.

      >>> paths = GraphSet.paths(1, 6)

      Convert GraphSet to EdgeVertexSetSet.

      >>> paths = paths.to_edgevertexsetset()
      >>> [(1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), 1, 4, 5, 6]
      True
      >>> len(paths)
      4

      Give constraints in which edge 1-4 must not be passed but 2 must
      be passed, and show the paths that meet the constraints.

      >>> paths = paths.excluding((1, 4)).including(2)
      >>> for path in paths:
      ...   path
      [(1, 2), (2, 5), (5, 6), 1, 2, 5, 6]
      [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 6), 1, 2, 3, 6]
