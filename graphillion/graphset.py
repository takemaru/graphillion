class GraphSet(object):
    """Represents and manipulates a set of graphs.

    A GraphSet object stores a set of graphs.  A graph stored must be
    a subgraph of the universal graph, and is represented by a list of
    edges in the universal graph.  An edge is a tuple of two vertices,
    and a vertex can be any hashable object like a number, a text
    string, and a tuple.  Currently, GraphSet only supports undirected
    graphs without edge labels.

    The universal graph must be defined before creating GraphSet
    objects by `GraphSet.set_universe()` method.

    Like Python set types, GraphSet supports `graph in graphset`,
    `len(graphset)`, and `for graph in graphset`.  It also supports
    all set methods and operators,
    * isdisjoint(), issubset(), issuperset(), union(), intersection(),
      difference(), symmetric_difference(), copy(), update(),
      intersection_update(), difference_update(),
      symmetric_difference_update(), add(), remove(), discard(),
      pop(), clear(),
    * ==, !=, <=, <, >=, >, |, &, -, ^, |=, &=, -=, ^=.

    Examples:
      >>> from graphillion import GraphSet

      We assume the following graph and register the edge list as the
      universe.

      1 --- 2 --- 3
      |     |     |
      4 --- 5 --- 6

      >>> universe = [(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)]
      >>> GraphSet.set_universe(universe)

      Find all paths from 1 to 6 and count them.

      >>> paths = GraphSet.paths(1, 6)
      >>> len(paths)
      4

      Give constraints in which edge 1-4 must not be passed but 2 must
      be passed, and show the paths that meet the constraints.

      >>> paths = paths.excluding((1, 4)).including(2)
      >>> for path in paths:
      ...   path
      [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 6)]
      [(1, 2), (2, 5), (5, 6)]

            Or constraints represented by a dict of included or
            excluded edge lists (not-specified edges are not cared):

            {'include': [(1, 4)], 'exclude': [(1, 2), (2, 3)]}

            If no argument is given, it is treated as an empty list
            `[]` and an empty GraphSet is returned.  An empty dict
            `{}` means that no constraint is specified, and so a
            GraphSet including all possible graphs in the universe is
            returned (let N the number of edges in the universe, 2^N
            graphs are stored in the new object).

            For `range(5)`, less than 5 edges can be used.
